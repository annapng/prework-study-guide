# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

This is a small starter website showing off what I've learned within the Prework course. It will act as a foundation of what I will learn throughout the rest of my time spent in the bootcamp. I think the most challenging part was learning Git/Bash, but after troubleshooting different issues that I had with it (such as creating a branch within another branch and screwing everything up!), I feel confident I can figure it out in the future.

## Usage

Each section contains different notes about the various subjects I learned about. I included extra notes about my biggest difficult part - Git. If you inspect, you'll be able to find the console and the Javascript working well inside of it.
